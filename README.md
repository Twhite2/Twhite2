## My Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I've worked on:

1. [MERN Chat Application](https://github.com/Twhite2/MERN_chatapp) 🚀 - A real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.
2. [Modelling DeskApp](https://github.com/Twhite2/Modelling_Deskapp) 🌐 - This is a simple 3d modelling tool used to make simple 3d models.
3. [FanbASE](https://github.com/Twhite2/fanbase) 🎉 - A simple customized blockchain system built with Rust designed to help content creators gain more from their Fanbase than they do from regular social media platforms.
