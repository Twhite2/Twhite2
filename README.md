<!-- About Me Section -->
## ✨ About Me

Welcome to my corner of the digital world. I'm Jarvis — a developer with **5 years** of experience building applications with a mix of precision, creativity, and discipline. I believe good code is like good storytelling: consistent, intentional, and always evolving.

🎓 I hold a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** and completed the rigorous **ALX SE Program** — think of it as my own version of mastering under someone like Koro-sensei: tough love, tight deadlines, and constant growth.

🛠️ My skillset spans a range of technologies:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** — quick on the draw, like Yoruichi
- **Python** — clean, efficient, and expressive (Shikamaru would approve)
- **C/C++** — old school, battle-tested, and still sharp like Guts’ sword
- **Rust** — unforgiving at first, but powerful in the right hands (much like Levi)
- **React** — smooth, component-based, and adaptive — think Senku solving UI problems
- **Networking** — invisible but essential, like Kaito’s influence in the background

I treat development like strategy — sometimes slow and thoughtful, other times fast and instinctive — always learning, always adapting.

## 🧩 Projects

Each project I work on has its own arc — a journey of discovery, challenge, and polish:

1. [**MERN Chat Application**](https://github.com/Twhite2/MERN_chatapp) 🗣️ — A real-time messaging app built with synergy and flow, the way a team like the Phantom Troupe moves.
2. [**Modelling DeskApp**](https://github.com/Twhite2/Modelling_Deskapp) 🎨 — Create, edit, and visualize 3D concepts like you’re building in a lab with Rintarou Okabe.
3. [**FanbASE**](https://github.com/Twhite2/fanbase) 🔗 — A platform that empowers creators and fans alike — a space even someone like Holo would respect for its value exchange.

There are more in my GitHub — a quiet garden of ideas, some fully bloomed, others still seeds.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I’m always open to projects that require heart, logic, and maybe a bit of madness — whether it’s prototyping something wild like Mayuri, or keeping things grounded and sharp like Makunouchi Ippo.
